especially from his interesting and full description of

the church itself, we may perhaps think it most ‘pro-

bable that he was connected with Westmiiister.- And

with this agrees the only hint he gives of himself,

where he speaks of how King Edward (vv. ·2o2o-2)--

after the battle of Lewes (1264); and the whole of
the Dedication seems to imply that the King and
