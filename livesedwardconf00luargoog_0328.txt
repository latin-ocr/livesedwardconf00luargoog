274: ΗΒΕ OF·

Devoutly to pray he eeases 11013.

After the service of 13116 mass

He went 130 dinner in his palace.

The king sab in the eentre of the dais 3
He is nob eourbeous who asks

If there was nob enough meam

The circle was large and quite full

Of counias, bamus, knights3

The table is all resplendent

With vessels of gold and silver.

Wii-‚h head reclined for a short time ,
Η6 remained in deep thoughb3

It had ‘ohe semblanee of a reverie3
Quiebly and by himself he smiled‚

And 1311611 like to a sage

He remained as he was 'before ι

Thanks 130 God he delays not to give.
The ehiefs observe it,

They understand that some secret

God has shewn from Heaven 130 the king.
But nevertheless aia table ¹

sNo one dared 130 ask:

They sear {30 anger him:

. Afber dinner they go into 13116 chamber3
Duke Harold follows him,

Summons a bishop 'oo him,

And an abbam he sayS, “ Dea-r friends
Thoughizs from God bring great good,
And make 0116 despise the vaniby

Of 13116 world, which is noughb but, falsifiy3

Know of whab I was thinking, friendS,
Aia table where I was sitting,

When I was somewha’n pensive3

The seven sleepers I saw in Greece, ⁸

-Who for many years thal] now are passed,

Have lain 011 their right sides3
