 

S. EDWARD THE CONFESSOR,

1895 Who clothed ’ohe naked poor
But Edward the holy, the geniale?
Who fed the hungry
But Edward the glorious2
Edward gave these gists‚
1900 Proclaimed deliverance from his prisone ;
Nor allowed himself bo be conquered by avarice,
But held it 05 a very great vice3
Of making excuses he was much ashamed,
Of gold 01· silvei* no account he made.
1905 His excellence increases from day to day,
And 1115 fame and his honours.
And 110 was of great humfflty ;
Of the needy- he had pity 3
without opposition and raillery
1910 He did. his altas in private 3
He had 11οὴ 111 1115 country a house
Of order and of religion
Which had nob from him 0, royal gift,
Which owed him not a blessing.
1915 N 01· ought I pass over nor to be silent
How gentle aznd debonair he was ;
By a history Ι will prove it
Which prevenias 0110 from forgebbing.

112 chanced ’chat King Edward
1 920 Was 01) London 111 his palace3
He went to the chapel of Sainl', Peter
Which was near, to hear 111055,
And a great circle of knigth
- . Among whom was Hugo 'ohe chamberlain.
1925 A poor man was sitting in the road
Deformed, a beggam and orphaned,
Guil Michel was 1115 1101110;
And he was Irish by nasim,
