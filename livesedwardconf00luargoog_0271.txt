S. EDWARD THE GONFESSOR.

The wind was as they wished
For coming straight 110 England3

21?

But when they should embark 111 then] ships  s⁴ ’ ’

1330 A missortune arrived 110 them: ,.
When 1116 waves were high and swollen.
The king who was 111611· sovereign, .
Weu I saw 111, well I know 111, well I relate 111,
As he wished 110 pass from 6 beat 011 heard,
‚1335 Fen between 11116 ship and the boat,

Supine and headlong 111 the sea‚¹ , ,

Η6 16 drowned‚ covered 111 the water , f .. ⁴. . ⁴ .

By a swellen and deep wave. .

Of 111111 afterwards they saw nothing3
1340 He perished‚ floabed down ‘ohe' flood.
When 111116 the whole 61111611161111 had seen,
Diseomfibed they soon return,
Of vengeanee much they rave,
Because they are destroyers and over’ourners.
{1345 Wherefore Ι tell yon, my good people,
Ῐ11 16 Almighty God
Has done this in love and gentleneSS‚
Who thus knows how to evenge his servants,
And 'no 6 61111161 discovers
1350 So glorious 6 misaele and deed.’'

Who are 1111616, it seems 6 marve13

Τ11611 ab Johis hour and on this day, ,
That bhey 16611111 111 from 1111611· lord, ⁴
The king died in embarking,
1360 Drowned by falling into 11116 666.
