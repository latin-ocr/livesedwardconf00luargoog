And arrives there with whatever pain (ib coste); 4005
This was the very week
{that King Edward passed
From the world. He mourned and lamenbed3
·“ Ah, debonair King Edward,
I can no longer keep from crying out 3 4010
Thou usedst to feed and clothe me,
So {ahala I could live and be ab ease,
But now Ι have a change without dying,
Who to die have great desire.
On all sides have I loss of goodS, 4015
1 am ill and 111 poverby· ‚
Eibher take me from ’01113 life
Or give me deliverance from my ills.’'
N 0 sooner had izhe deformed man ended these words,
Than he was cured 3 4020
On his legs and his *feet he riseS,
He feels there nothing which huri-‚s him.
To all those who are there ’nogether
It seems a wonder of 11110 healing power.
’ Increased and renewed is 4025
The fame and renown of the king,

Since to the needy he gave such comfort
Before and after his ’ death. ἦ

Diverse greces and virtues

Had King Edward above al13 4030
Cure oifS x But in restoring sight ·
ΒΗ ¹¹⁶ Men ’He had never, as 1 believe, his equal.

In the month in which the king died,

It chanced, as I well relate it to you,

Six blind men by one, who had 4035

Only a, single eye with which he could see,

Are conducted through the country,

As poor mendicant-,s ill ab ease3

So Ι can and will speak a marvel,
The seven blind men had one eye. 4040
