S. EDWARD THE coNFEsson.

After great perils and sorrows
My father is dead, a shorb life had 11e3
My mobher Emma, the queen,
765 Pricks my 116611, as does a thorn,
Who of Onut to 1116 made a steps-ather,
And from 1110151161· made herself step-mother.
So much has he changed the whole condition
Of our kingdom, and this confusion ariseS,
’7¹70 So much with bastardy was
The land entirely filled3
For all the royal line
He slew with suffering-s and outrage.
My nepheWS, the sone of Edrmmd,
'775 No one knows what has become of them.
Ah, Edmund, 11011 11661116ᾶ,
Thou too perishedst by the treason
Of Godwin, the Earl of Rem,
The flabberer who is buoyed up and depende
’ 780 Upon treason, sin, and wrong,
Who delivered up my brother 130 death.
Sweyn and 011111) with their Danes
’ Have slain bhe gentle English, .
Whose parents, whose ancestors
785 Were noble conquerors ι
Coming in the company
.. Of Brutus of the bold eounssenance
'⁴ ἦ Who arrived with a grear navy
From mighty Troy, the flower of Asia.
790 Alae Ξ what thou wilt de, England‚
Where bhou wilt be able hester to eeek counsel,
I know nol-‚3 but Ι pray the Almighty
Thass He may have pity Speedily on it,
And 011 me his own Edward,
795 Who carry in my 116611, a dart of grief ;·
