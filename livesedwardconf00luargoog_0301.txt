S. EDWARD THE CONFESSOR.

Thanks Ι give with joined hands ·

2395 To God and the saints of Heaven3
Who have inclined your heart ·
To love and honour uS,
And to obey the apostleS,
And to agree to our intention

2400 Through the power and dig-nity
Which is given to me by God:
And may γοα have full blessing
And pardon of your, sins 3 ι
And I grant you my prayerS,

2405 As did Pope Leo for himself 3 ’
And if now I do a right thing,
May you have an equal share With myse1f3
So that from an earthly kingdom
You may pass to a Heavenly3

2410 In Heaven may you have joy and glory,
011, earth victory over your 6116111166,
From ills God grant you release,
May he confirm your reign in peace.
Ι confirm to you and to you grant

’ 2415 Whatever before< me gave you

Leo the just Pope,
That there may not be ever a mortal man
After me, prinoe or Pope‚ “
Who at any time shall infringe or take away
2420 The dignities of your churoh,
Or the right or the freedom.
By my power aforesaid,
.. Free from subjection to the bishop
Let it always be; and let there be no patron

’ 2425 Of this ohuroh ever but the king3

And there let the king be consecrated,
Plaoed 011 his throne and crowned3 ⁴
And there be the regalia preserved -
In sure and ‘certain protection‚

2430 Of which let the abbat and the convent

Be guardians for ever„
