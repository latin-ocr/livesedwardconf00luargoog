a learned appearance by exbracbing examples -of the
words from other poenis and dictionem-iem but this
seemed to me very different. from what, 18 desired
111 such a publication as bhe present. ¹ The books
which I have chiefly used in this compilation
are Kelharn’s Dictionary of the N ermom or Old
Fremh Lomyuaye, Lond. 17793 Requefort'e Gloseaire
de la Lanyue Romame, Par. 18083 the Gloeeai‘re
Franpwzs in 1110 seventh volume of Henschel's edition
of Du Gange, Par. 18503 and Burguy's Grmmaizre de
la Langyue d’ O‘il, Berlin, 1853, a most invaluable
work for all studente of 111118 language‚ and {30 which
I must express my especial obligations?

The period of history embraced’ 111 'eliis MS. extends

of History over the whole life of Edward 1110 Confessum, the author

³ It 18 very difficolt to draw the
line accurately as to what words
should be admitted into, and what
excluded from, such a glossary. My
wish has been to insert all that are
not found in the ordinary French
dictionarieS, and to err 011 the side
of inserting rather too much, than
too little: References to the lines of

θ the Poem where the words occur

have been added when the word 18
found only in 0110 place, or where the
line referred to gives a good example
of its use. In two ⁰¹.' three instances

ordinary French words have been ·-
inserted, when these might have
been mistaken for other werde, spelt
in the same way, which occur in
the MS,

2 I have also 0008011011, among
other glossarie3‚ Michel’s Glossary
appended to the Che-cuique des Duce
de Normandie‚ Par. 1844. But M.
Burguy has made 80 much use of this
poem in collecting his examples
as almost vo supersede the use of ’
