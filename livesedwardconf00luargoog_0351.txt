Who ⁴now fails 1101 at his need,

And makes King· Harold entirely cured t
Now he has 110 more anxiety nor pain,
But 11161 116 may conquer 1116 N orwegians

4185 , There was an 6101161, of Ramsey,
Whose name was Alexis, of holy life,
And 10 him appeared Sainb Edward.
“ Listen‚ friend,’' says he, “ here.

So that 116 should 1101 have victory 61 1116 desire3

As for his good I tell him -ι
'And 161, 111111 not be 60 daring as 10 attempt.

4210 And 11116 abbat when he hears it,
Goes to 1611 the king the message,
