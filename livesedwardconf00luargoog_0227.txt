Foebleness quite prostrates him ι

With difficulty regalia and erown

But 15116 service comforts him.

The bwo monks appear 150 111111,

Who formerly were his dear friends,‚
And tell 111111 13116 prophecy ,

And speaks quite distinotly

So sshab 110 0116 who is 1311616 does 1101, hear-3
And 15116 voice recounts to 15116111 with eagerness
His vision openly.
