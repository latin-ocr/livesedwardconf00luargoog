S. EDWARD THE CONFESSOR.

That against him could make 110 resistance
200 Τ116 people of the country. ⁴

Ethelred 130 N ormandy
Flies to save his 'life ε
Wherefore was Sweyn more fieree and bold,
When the people lost comfort3
205 And caused himself to be called king,
And did outrage and great disorder3
Property be robbed out of all boundS,
without piby ancl without right 3 -
Then he came into bhe country of Sainb Edmund‚
210 Where he desssroys all and confounds all 3
He demands property for his exactions

Elight of
Ethelred to
Nomandy.

Beyond the power (of the people) and without reason 3⁴ ⁴

The people poor and already destroyed
Fly to the martyr Edmund, ⁴

215 And cry to their Lord,
And he avenges them with great readiness 3⁴
Ab night came bo him the vengeanee ’
That he was piereed with a lance.

N ow come into Bag-land,
220 To make war and ho conquer,
From Denmark with a powerful army
Of Danes a great company,
Who eovetous, selom, emel,
Love war more than peace.

225 The country they close in and destroy‚
Who even children and women slay,
Who 'put to flame and ashes
Sooner chureh than house.

„ This one slays, this despoiIS, this burne,

230 Illfireated is every paria. · ⁴ ⁴

When King Ethelred knows this,
No wonder is it if it grieves fhim,

Ι Death of
