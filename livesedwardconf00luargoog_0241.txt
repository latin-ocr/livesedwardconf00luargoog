3. EDWARD THE. coNFEssoR. · 18'7

Nor could one find in 1116 whole world '
2¹70 An equal to Cnut and Edmund. ·

When the 0116 and 1116 other consoni, bo it,
The kings arm themselves with great courbesy, -
With 00313 of mail and shining 1161111613,
And mount their swiffi ‘war 1101363;

275 Their lances 30011 they break, ’
The splinbers of which fly far3

⁴ Then {zhey seize their furbished brantio,

Now begins ‘ohe combab:
The blows are hard which each giveS,

280 Each 111 striking sbuns the other 3.
Nor ’011 131113 side ean bhe Englishman 1103313,
Nor on the other side the Dane ⁴3
The Earl displays' more skffl,
But Edmund, was more vigorouS‚

285 For young and hardened was 116;
The other, wise and older,
And 1633 gifted with strength,
Feels that> Edmund was long· W-inded3
And the longer the fight laets

290 The fiesher and fiercer leaps 011 111111,

’ And 13 stronger in 'ohe battle,

⁴ And sbrikes with the greater violence3 ,

Nor can Cnub long endure3

' But he seigns himself quibe fresh and strong,

295 Makes a fieroe assault on Edmund,

Strikes and sbrikes again·; ⁴so that from 1116 middle ⁴

Of Edmund's shieId he breaks off a pieoe‚ ’
’ Of 1113 armour breaks a link,
With his brand of steel which 611153 30 WelL
300 Then he saysz “ Edmund, friend„
Now lisizen bo what Ι tell you..
Ι Muoh would be the grief and 1033
