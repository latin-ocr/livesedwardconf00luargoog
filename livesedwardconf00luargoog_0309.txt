⁴ Cure of a
“ Blind Man.

Saint. Paul tells us¹; some are full
Of good sense, others sbrong and healbhful3
One is knowing and this 0116 is sensihle,
The other mainbains a. firm saith.

2690 This saint, of whom I write and. breat,
As his works bear witness,‚
Grace had especially ,
Above all saints, as Ι understand,
Το eure 311 the blind

2695 By his prayer and his virtue3
And ’chere 3661113 reason and right ”
That he who had 3 sou] clear and pure,
Should be able bo enlighten the darkened,
And thus to cure {ahe⁴ blind.

2700 So my subj ech reminds me
To speak of another miraele
Of . which I have made mention,

How 3 good man was enred,
Who had been blind from infaney‚

2705 Famed and well known,
And was entirely blind
without worldly pleaeure and light.
“ Ah 1 God, '’ this is what people said,
“Who sees not. 'ohis man, much mansela?
2710 ΑΗ 13116 substance of 1113 eyes
He had, but he saw not, ab 311.
To this man, of whom I speak and ten yon,
0116 night when 116 was asleep, ’
said one, I 631111οὺ ‘say wh0,
2715 He was from God,assured1y do I believe,
In 3 manifesb vision
Which afterwards was well proved. 1³0 certainty,
“Go 'obouj' 3ο spake the voice,
“Who desires’t» to have restoration of thy eyeS‚
