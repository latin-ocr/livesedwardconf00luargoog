 

S. EDWARD THE coNFESSOR.

2610 If, took away her happiness and joy,
Tainted and clarkened her colour,
In her neck she had bare swellings,
Which are usually called scrofulous 3
They turn to rotbenneSS, ’

2615 Putrified‚ and swollen‚ and full of matter,
Which with ‚pain and suffering
From the throat. took their rise3
Her face by it was much inim-ed, '
Mutilatetl and disfigured 3

2620 The putrefaction ‘and the sore

Sent forth so fearful a sten0h‚
Thab she had no ffiend who would approach her
without derision and reproach3
. For she who once was young ancl beautiful,
2625 Is despised and appears leprouS.
⁴No one took care of her,
Even her husband held her in contempl),
She has no friend to comfort her,
Much she longs for death,
2630 N ot only for one ill that} troubles her,
For her grief is now double3
By a misfortune which wounds her
And inm-casce, she becomes barren.
By her long illness, and giving ear

253

2635 To physicians, she had done nough't. but expend money,

She now hopes for succour from no mortal,
But only from the God of Heaven ;
To die she desires, but she can
N oh die, for God wills it not'3

2640 She falls into a wretched state of grief}
That death makes so long delay for her,
So cruel and great were her ’ ills.

One nighh she is scarcely asleep,
And she hears a command,
2645 Thala in 13116 morning early
