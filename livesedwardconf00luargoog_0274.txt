And 861111, John the Evangelist3

Thus I went one day very sad .

Into 6 church where 1 prayed, 1435
.· Ι surrendered 1111376611ι to these four

To order my whole life,

And I made 6 vow, Ι ought nob to conceal it, 1,
For myself and for my heritage, ’
And for you who are my bal-onage, 1440
To go to Rome to pray3 .

So I wish, very deal· lords 11610116,
By your aid 1·,0 perform this jem-hey„ ι
Τ1161, it may accord with God's pleasure and· yours ι,
Not to oppose my purpose, 1445
Tha'o God may bc wrath with me and you, . .
Who said, 66 I find and read {zo 37011,
‘ Vow, pay what you 116176 promised' ¹
What 1 desired God 1166 accomplished 1
And much more 1166 1116 mercy3 , 1450
It 16 not right {ahat I should delay -
Το pay my service and my v0w3
His 0¹.. But 37011, 101116, and you, commone,

&133⁰ssss Who are the kingdom and the crown‚

people. If you well keep together, ῃ ’ 1455 ξ
Ῡο11 have no neighbour who wil] nob fear you and dread
Το trouble you3 if one habes the other . ,
Α11(1 you him, and he paine and grieves you, Ι ’
When the enemy 1166 heard 6637 this, ἱ
Both of you he 6611 discomfib. 1 460 ,
If I hold 6 6111611 weak and slender
In my small and slight. hand
Withou't, difficulty 1 can ‘break 11, with my fist3 ὲ
If six 01· seven long and old
Sticks bogether you bie, 1465

The people in a coun’ory3
If they love each other, 1111637 have nought. 10111, good3
